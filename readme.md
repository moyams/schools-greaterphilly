## Schools in the Greater Philadelphia Area
________
#### Skye Moya
This project is designed to showcase the density distribution of schools within the greater Philadelphia area. This map shows each school location as a point and the choropleth symbolization shows the density of points within their given districts. The districts within the Philadelphia city limits were sourced from a "council district 2016 geojson" file and the greater Philadelphia area was a hand-drawn shapefile of the surrounding counties based on a Pennsylvania Spatial Data Access county shapefile. My data points were collected from Google Maps coordinates and Philadelphia open-source data to create the school.geoJson file. QGIS was used to count points within polygons and create my “greaterphilly. geojson”.  CSS, Javascript, and HTML were used to create my cohesive web map. Within this code, the major functions were used to create a legend, set color density, and style. The libraries used within this code are leaflet AJAX, chroma JS, leaflet, CSS, and a font awesome plug-in.
